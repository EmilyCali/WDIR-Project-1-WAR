    <h3> How to Play </h3>
    <p> This is a browser based version of the popular cardgame War. To start the deck is shuffled and split between two players, resulting in each player having 26 cards. Players will then flip the top card of their face down cards to show its value. The player with the card of higher value will take both face up cards and the player with the most cards at the end is the winner of the round. To win the game a player would have all 52 cards.
