    <h2> How to Play </h2>
    <p> This is a browser based version of the popular cardgame War. To start, the deck is shuffled and split evenly between two players. Players will then flip the top card of their face down cards to show its value. The player with the card of higher value wins both face up cards. If there is a tie it's war! The next draw determines who gets the tie cards and the battling cards, again, the player with the higher value card gets the cards. When a player runs out of cards in their hand they pull from thier won cards pile, at the end of a round the player with the most won cards gets a point. To win the game a player would have all 52 cards. Please note, for this game, Aces = 1.
